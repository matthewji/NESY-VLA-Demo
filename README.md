# NeSy-VLA: Bridging Human-like Reasoning with Edge-native Performance

## Project Vision
This project transcends traditional computer vision by implementing a **Neuro-Symbolic Vision-Language-Action (NeSy-VLA)** framework, specifically engineered for high-performance inference on resource-constrained edge devices like the Intel NUC. Unlike conventional deep learning systems that rely on exhaustive, labeled datasets for every possible defect scenario, our approach integrates **Gemma 3’s sophisticated world knowledge** to perform **Zero-shot logical reasoning**.

## Technical Sophistication
By defining physical constraints through symbolic logic—such as the structural integrity and expected dimensions of a functional object—the system can autonomously identify anomalies it has never encountered during training. To ensure this complex cognitive pipeline operates in real-time, we have integrated the **OpenXLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra)** compiler, which performs deep-level kernel fusion and optimizes the execution graph specifically for the CPU's instruction set, including **AVX-512**.

## Key Technical Innovations
* **Zero-Shot Adaptability**: Powered by Gemma 3's "Human-like Reasoning" to detect defects without specific training data.
* **Edge-Native AI**: Achieves high-speed performance on Intel CPUs without requiring dedicated GPU hardware.
* **OpenXLA Optimization**: Reduces latency significantly through graph-level compilation and AVX-512 vectorization.
* **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Provides clear logical justifications for defect detection (e.g., structural length constraints).

## Architecture & Performance
This synergy between sub-symbolic perception (YOLOv11) and symbolic reasoning (Gemma 3) represents the vanguard of **Neuro-Symbolic AI**, offering a scalable, explainable, and energy-efficient solution for the next generation of industrial autonomous inspection.
